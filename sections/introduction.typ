#slide(title: "Why a Package Manager for Prolog", outlined: true)[
  - Software design requires management of abstraction and modularity
  - Code reusability is essential for productive development
  - Popular languages thrive due to rich package ecosystems:
    - Domain-specific: HTTP servers, physics engines, etc.
    - Building blocks: error handling, stream processing, type systems, etc.
  - *Prolog's ecosystem lags behind in that regard*, making development harder
  - A package manager would help Prolog compete with modern languages
